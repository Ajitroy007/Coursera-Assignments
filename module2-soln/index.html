                <p>
                    Something interesting about mankind. Homo sapiens has kept hidden an even more disturbing secret. Not only do we
                    possses an abundance of uncivilized cousins, once upon a time we had quite a few brothers abd sisters as well.
                    We are used to thinking about ourselves as the only humans,because for the last 10,000 years, our species has indeed
                    been the only human species around.

                    The lion  is a species in the family Felidae; it is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. The lion is sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females with a typical weight range of 150 to 250 kg (330 to 550 lb) for males and 120 to 182 kg (265 to 400 lb) for females.

                <h2>Homo Neanderthals</h2>
                <p>
                   Neanderthals (the ‘th’ pronounced as ‘t’) are our closest extinct human relative. Some defining features of their skulls include the large middle part of the face, angled cheek bones, and a huge nose for humidifying and warming cold, dry air. Their bodies were shorter and stockier than ours, another adaptation to living in cold environments. But their brains were just as large as ours and often larger - proportional to their brawnier bodies.
